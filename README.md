# Bank-Marketing
<p align="justify"> Marketing refers to activities undertaken by a company to promote the buying or selling of a product or service.
Marketing includes advertising, selling, and delivering products to consumers or other businesses. 
Here we are analysing the marketing data of a Portoguese banking instituition which is based on phone calls. 
Potential clients are contacted through phone calls to access if the bank term deposit would be subscribed or not.</p>

### Business Problem
<p align="justify"> The business problem is a binary classification problem. The classification goal is to predict if the client
contacted through the marketing campaign will subscribe a term deposit. </p><p align="justify"> 

### Dataset
<p align="justify"> The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on
phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit)
would be (or not) subscribed. </p>
